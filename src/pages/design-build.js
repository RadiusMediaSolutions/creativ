						We implement the Design/Build approach toward projects
						because it makes a sizable impact on your budget and
						your timeline. Our proven methodology combines the
						services of architects, engineers, and construction
						managers as one unified team. This streamlines the
						entire process and gives you more control over your
						project.
					</GenericPara>
					<h3>ADVANTAGES OF THE SKYNET DESIGN/BUILD APPROACH</h3>
					<h4>1. Modernized dependability</h4>
					<p>
						The Skynet team is the focal point of engagement for
						your project. We are your direct connection to all of
						the operations for your build.
					</p>
					<h4>2. Quality workmanship</h4>
					<p>
						We offer a network of talented architects, engineers,
						and project managers that have delivered excellent
						craftsmanship time after time.
					</p>
					<h4>3. Monetary advantages</h4>
					<p>
						Pricing set during the design stage enables clients to
						have foresight as the project advances and expanded
						power over possible revisions.
					</p>
					<h4>4. Streamlined completion</h4>
					<p>
						The design-build method provides a 33% faster finish
						than the design-spec-bid-build manner.
					</p>
					<h4>5. Decreased risk</h4>
					<p>
						Collaboration in the initial stages lessens project
						uncertainties connected with expense and agenda.
					</p>
					<h3>

						When you take advantage of our Design-Build services,
						you can relax knowing that your project is handled in
						one, all-inclusive contract. This turn-key solution
